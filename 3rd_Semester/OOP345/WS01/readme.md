# Workshop 1: Across Translation Units

In this workshop, you implement aspects of linkage, storage duration, namespaces, header guards, and operating system interfaces.



## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:
- receive program arguments from the command line
- guard a class definition from duplication in a translation unit
- access a variable defined in a different translation unit
- declare a local variable that resides in memory throughout the lifetime of the program
- upgrade code to accept and manage a user-defined string of any length



## Submission Policy

The workshop is divided into two coding parts and one non-coding part:

- *Part 1*: worth 0% of the workshop's total mark, is optional and designed to assist you in completing the second part.
- *Part 2*: worth 100% of the workshop's total mark, is due on **Sunday at 23:59:59** of the week of your scheduled lab.  Submissions of *Part 2* that do not contain the *reflection* are not considered valid submissions and are ignored.
- *reflection*: non-coding part, to be submitted together with *Part 2*. The reflection does not have marks associated to it, but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).

The workshop should contain ***only work done by you this term*** or provided by your professor.  Work done in another term (by you or somebody else), or work done by somebody else and not **clearly identified/cited** is considered plagiarism, in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top **your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

- If the file contains only your work, or work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

    > I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

- If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which parts of the assignment are given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing.



## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++17`: the code will be compiled using the C++17 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as following to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind ws
```

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.






## The application

The application tracks events that occur at given times in a day, and executes a set of actions on the current event.

The application maintains a system clock (representing the time of day), then loads from a file the actions that must be executed:
- `T` - *time*: all following actions must be executed (in sequence) when the system clock reaches the time following `T`
- `S` - *start*: at the current time, a new event starts; the name of the event follows `S`
- `E` - *end*: the current event has ended and no other event is happening right now
- `P` - *print*: display the current event to the screen
- `A` - *archive*: add the current event to an archive of current events for future reference.




## Part 1 (0%)

This workshop consists of two modules:
- `w1` (partially supplied)
- `Event`



### `w1` Module (partially supplied)

Study the code supplied and make sure you understand it.

Finish the implementation of the `main` function, by completing the parts marked with `TODO`:

- write the prototype of the `main` function to receive a set of standard command line arguments
- echo the set of arguments to standard output in the following format:
```
1: first argument
2: second argument
3: third argument
4: ...
```

**Do not modify this module in any other place!**



### `Event` Module

The `Event` module defines a system clock, as a global variable named `g_sysClock` that stores only positive integers.  The value of the clock represents the time of day as the number of seconds since midnight (an integer between 0 and 86400; choose an appropriate type). This clock will be accessed when a new event starts and from the `main` function.



This module also defines a class named `Event` in the namespace `sdds` that stores some information about an event:

- a C-style null-terminated string of up to 128 characters *including the null byte terminator* representing the description of the event.

- the time when the event starts, expressed in number of seconds that passed from midnight. The time must be an integer between 0 and 86400 (choose an appropriate type).

**Public Members**
- Default constructor
- `display()`: a query that displays to the screen the content of an `Event` instance in the following format:
    ```
    COUNTER. HH:MM:SS => DESCRIPTION
    ```
    If no description has been stored in the current object, this query should print:
    ```
    COUNTER. | No Event |
    ```
    where
    - `COUNTER` is a field of size 2, that holds the number of times that this function has been called (use a local-to-function variable that remains in memory for the lifetime of the program) **Do not use global/member variables to store the counter!**
    - `HH:MM:SS` represents the time when the event started, expressed in hours, minutes and seconds
- `set()`: a modifier that receives the address of an array of characters (by default, the parameter is null).
    - If the address is not null and the array is not empty, this function starts a new event and stores the information about this event in the current instance.
    - If the address is null or the array is empty, this function resets the current instance to an empty state.

Add any other **private** members that your design requires (without changing the specs above)!



### Sample Output

The input files `monday.txt` and `tuesday.txt` are already provided; the main module contains a description of the structure for these files.

When the program is started with the command:
```
ws monday.txt tuesday.txt
```
the output should look like the one from the `sample_output.txt` file.




### Test Your Code

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the output example above.

Upload your source code to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w1_p1
```
and follow the instructions.

***This part represents a milestone in completing the workshop and is not marked!***



 
## Part 2 (100%)

For this part of the workshop, upgrade your `Event` class to accept a description in the form of a C-style null-terminated string of any length.  **Make sure your program doesn't have memory leaks.**


### Sample Output

When the program is started with the command:
```
ws monday.txt tuesday.txt
```
the output should look like the one from the `sample_output.txt` file.




### Reflection

Study your final solution, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop. **This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time and the result is suggested to be at least 150 words in length.**

Create a **text** file named `reflect.txt` that contains your ***detailed*** description of the topics that you have learned in completing this workshop and mention any issues that caused you difficulty and how you solved them. Include in your explanation—**but do not limit it to**—the following points:
- the difference between internal and external linkage citing examples from your code
- what are `static` variables and how are they useful in your solution.
- the changes that you made in upgrading your `Event` class.

To avoid deductions, refer to code snippets in your solution as examples to support your explanations.




### Submission

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the output example above.

Upload the source code and the reflection file to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w1_p2
```
and follow the instructions.

**:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Resubmissions will attract a penalty.
