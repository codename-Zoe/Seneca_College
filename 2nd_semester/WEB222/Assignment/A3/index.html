        Its color of crown and nape are rich chestnut, and its ears are kidney-shaped black. Its
        beak is blue in the summer, becoming black in the winter and under its chin and throat are
        also black. Its wings are mixed light and brown and there are 2 white bars on them. There is
        no difference between males and females such as appearance, plumage. The juveniles
        look-alike to the adults, though the color of their plumage is a blur. From autumn to
        winter, they gain their weight despite decreasing their stored fat. The change is because of
        accelerating feather growth and containing water in the body.

        and sometimes they pick up food from trees or grasses.

        In spring and fall, males appeal to females by chirping and flapping their wings. Their
        chirp sound is used to socialize and attract females.

        They are living in open, wooded places such as villages, parks and farmland, but some
        species such as house sparrows are living in the human habitations.

        Those birds from Germany have more syllable types and less structure in the population than
        the US birds. Their population in North America is small and it caused a loss of genetic
        diversity. For the most part of their habitat is in Europe and some countries in Asia. As
        you can see from their name, they live on Eurasian Continent. According to
        <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/13851-Passer-montanus">iNaturalist</a>, they are
        not living near Toronto.

        It is believed that its origin is in Africa. Studies say that Eurasian tree sparrows
        branched from the other Eurasian members of its genus early, to plain-backed and Spanish
        sparrows. Eurasian tree sparrow and American tree sparrow are not related, they are in a
        different family.

      <h2>
        <a id="origin">Origin of name</a>
        <hr width="1000" />
      </h2>
      <p>
        The name, Eurasian tree sparrow, comes from two Latin words: passer as “sparrow” and
        montanus as “of the mountains”. The name is given because they prefer to nest in the holes
        in trees. They are distributed in the east of the US but not that many.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <a id="relationship">Relationship with humans</a>
        <hr width="1000" />
      </h2>
      <p>
        In some countries, the Eurasian tree sparrow is classified as a pest. They eat cereal and
        fruits from fields and fruit farms and their dropping makes the grains spoiled. In
        Australia, it is forbidden to bring this species into Western Australia by quarantine rules.
        In China, the government tried to decrease the damage of crops by Eurasian tree sparrows, by
        placing many scarecrows and it drove the birds to death. However, by doing so, the number of
        insect pests increased because those insects are usually consumed by the birds. As a result,
        this “Four pests campaign” caused a famine and over 30 million people died between 1959 and
        1961.

        <li>
          Eurasian tree sparrows typically live near the human habitat, but it has been moved from
          urban area to rural area because they are larger and more aggressive than House sparrows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eurasian tree sparrows vary in its plumage and size and it has been distinguished into 33
          subspecies outside of North America. The North American birds are from the most widespread
          subspecies called ”montanus”.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most long-lived Eurasian tree sparrow in North America was over 4 years old and it was
          recorded in Illinois in 1972, but the typical lifespan is about 3 years.
