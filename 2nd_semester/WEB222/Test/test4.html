            RE: An HTML Letter
        </h1>
        <p>
            Dear WEB 222 Student:
        </p>

        <p>The <b>first</b> paragraph of a <em>typical</em> business letter is used to state the main point of the letter.
            Begin with a friendly opening, then quickly transition into the purpose of your letter. Use a couple of sentences to explain the purpose,
            but do not go into detail until the next paragraph.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beginning with the second paragraph, state the supporting details to justify your purpose. These may take various forms, including:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    background information
                </li>
                <li>
                    statistics
                </li>
                <li>
                    first-hand accounts
                </li>
            </ul>
            A few short paragraph within the body of the letter should be enough to support your reasoning.
            For example, you could include a quote like the following:
            <blockquote>
                "I love the deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by."Douglas Adams
            </blockquote>
            It's obviously a good idea to include hyperlinks like <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html">this one to Seneca's home page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, if you want to showcase some of your source code, do that with an appropriate element to make it look correct, for example
            <code>&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/155/354864230_a8felfe864_z.jpg" alt="cat"&gt;</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, in the closing paragraph, briefly restate your purpose and why it is important. If the purpose of your letter is employment related,
            consider ending your letter with your contact information. However,if the purpose is informational,
            think about closing with gratitude for the reader's time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sincerely,
        </p>

        <p>
            Test Four
        </p>
